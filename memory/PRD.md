## Implemented (most recent first)

### Feb 2026 — Phase 1: Past Projects (SEO foundation)
- **Public routes**: `/projects` (index w/ tag filter chips) and `/projects/:slug` (detail w/ gallery, specs, 5-step journey timeline, customer story, related projects, sticky mobile CTA).
- **Backend**: `GET /api/projects` (filterable list), `GET /api/projects/{slug}` (public), full admin CRUD at `/api/admin/projects/*`. Mongo `projects` collection with indexes on slug/published/tags.
- **SEO**: `react-helmet-async` integrated; per-page `<title>` set via `document.title` (sidesteps strict-mode helmet quirk); meta description, canonical, OG, Twitter, Schema.org `CreativeWork` JSON-LD (dangerouslySetInnerHTML).
- **Admin Projects CRUD**: new sidebar item "Projects" with full form — basics, slug auto-gen, hero image R2 upload, gallery (final + 3D-render variants), specs (carat/shape/setting/metal/color/clarity/cert), journey timeline builder, customer story, tag preset picker, SEO fields, publish/featured/position.
- **Landing nav**: added "Projects" link in WizardShell header (only on landing) and in landing footer.
- **Seed data**: `/app/backend/seed_projects.py` inserts 3 sample projects so the design verifies end-to-end.

### Earlier in this session
- **"Here's how it works"** wizard interstitial (3-step timeline + assurances + back button + mobile size tune-up).
- **Landing comparison panel**: removed dropdown, made highlighted side-by-side panel with VS badge + savings bar.
- **CTA microcopy**: small "Takes about 90 seconds · No payment required" reassurance line under every wizard-starting CTA.

### Pre-fork
- 12-tab Advanced Analytics suite, render→product showcase, Cloudflare R2 uploads, customer OTP auth + dashboard, admin JWT login + CRM + showcase + settings + tracking + orders.

## Key DB Schema
- `users {phone, email, name, otp, otp_expiry}`
- `leads {user_id, answers, events, status, stage, comments, inspiration_files, inspiration_links, sms_opt_in}`
- `showcase_pairs {pair_id, title, render_image, product_image, order}`
- `events {event_name, event_data, anonymous_id, session_id, server_timestamp}`
- `settings` (single doc)
- **`projects` (NEW)** `{project_id, slug (unique), title, subtitle, hero_image_url, gallery[], specs{carat,shape,setting_style,metal,color,clarity,certification,cert_number,cert_link}, journey[{label,description,image_url}], customer_story{name,location,quote,date}, tags[], description, meta_title, meta_description, published, featured, position, created_at, updated_at}`

## Key API Endpoints
- `/api/wizard/start`, `/api/wizard/submit`, `/api/wizard/{lead_id}/autosave`
- `/api/events` (analytics)
- `/api/admin/analytics/*` (12-tab suite)
- `/api/showcase-pairs` (public)
- **`/api/projects`** (public list w/ tag filter), **`/api/projects/{slug}`** (public detail)
- **`/api/admin/projects`** (admin CRUD)
- `/api/uploads` (R2)

## Recent Updates
- **2026-02 · Voice note "Talk to your jeweler"** — Hero now has a mic recorder that uploads to R2 as `inspiration_voice` on the lead; admin LeadsCRM detail panel renders an inline HTML5 audio player + download. Hero headline updated to "The most personal engagement ring buying experience online."
- 2026-02 · Pinterest API research scoped (paused; user pivoted to voice note feature)

## Recent Updates
- **2026-05 · Phase 3 multi-feature ship (price tags, marketplace chat, blog CMS, contact page, mobile nav menu, sticky project CTA fix)** — verified by testing agent: 25/25 backend tests pass, all frontend flows working including blog detail (after Helmet `<title>` imperative fix matching ProjectDetailPage pattern).
  - **Pricing**: `price`, `price_prefix`, `price_currency` on projects; eye-catching green PriceTag badge on cards + large hero badge on detail.
  - **Marketplace inquiry chat** (Facebook-style): editable "Hi - is this available?" bar on project detail → inline name/email/phone gate → creates `message_threads` collection + lead + JWT, fires SendGrid notif + best-effort Twilio SMS on admin reply. Admin inbox at `/admin/messages`, customer view on dashboard "Messages" tab.
  - **Blog CMS**: TipTap WYSIWYG editor at `/admin/blog`, public `/blog` index + `/blog/:slug` detail with JSON-LD BlogPosting schema, included in sitemap.xml.
  - **Contact page** at `/contact` with phone/email/location cards + form posting to `/api/contact` → `contact_submissions` collection + admin email notif.
  - **Mobile nav fix**: replaced ambiguous icon-only Projects link with proper text-based "Menu" dropdown (Projects · Journal · Contact) on PublicHeader + WizardShell.
  - **Sticky CTA fix**: all "Start a piece like this" buttons on project pages now open Quick Quote modal pre-filled with project context instead of navigating to homepage.
- 2026-02 · Voice note ("Talk to your jeweler") in hero
- 2026-02 · Pinterest API research paused (5 pin types planned; user pivoted)

## Backlog / Roadmap

### P1 — Phase 2 (Pinterest API automation — paused)
- Five pin types per product: Hero, Lifestyle, Mood-board, Video, Carousel
- Requires Standard access (POST /v5/pins), OAuth 2.0 with `pins:write` / `boards:write`, video upload flow (register → upload → confirm → create pin), carousel (multi `media_source`), and a custom mood-board image generator (Pinterest has no native collage API)
- AI prompt for title/description/alt-text already provided by user — ready to wire to Emergent LLM key once integration approved

### P1 — Phase 2 (SEO landing pages)
- Build template SEO landing pages: `/custom-engagement-rings`, `/oval-lab-diamond-engagement-rings`, `/orlando-custom-engagement-rings`, `/hidden-halo-engagement-rings`, etc.
- One reusable template (code-config, per user choice) that auto-pulls matching projects by tag, adds FAQ schema, internal linking.

### P1 — Phase 3 (SEO polish)
- Dynamic `/sitemap.xml` (FastAPI endpoint pulling projects + SEO landing slugs) + `/robots.txt`
- Schema.org `FAQPage` on SEO landing pages
- Open Graph image generation per project

### Other P1
- Wire `LandingScreen.js` hardcoded social-proof counts / phone / location → `/api/admin/settings`

### P2
- Quotation email sending + status tracking (Sent/Viewed/Accepted/Rejected)
- Order management — convert accepted quote → formal order
- Dynamic email notification settings → backend logic

### Refactor candidates
- Modularize `server.py` / `admin_routes.py` into `/app/backend/routes/*` once they grow further

## Update 2026-06-10 — E-commerce Storefront (Phase 1) ✅ SHIPPED & TESTED (iteration_7: 26/26 backend, all FE flows pass)

**Goal:** Turn the lead-gen site into a transactional D2C sales engine with best-in-class SEO. Reference: diamondrensu.com.

**Delivered:**
- **Admin-editable Mega-Menu header** (`MegaMenuHeader.js`) — desktop dropdowns with a preview image that swaps as you hover each sub-link; mobile slide-out accordion; sticky condense-on-scroll; announcement bar; cart icon. Replaces the landing header (wizard still intact below).
- **Sellable Product catalog + Collections** — `products` & `collections` Mongo collections. Public pages: `/collections`, `/collections/:slug` (grid + sort), `/products/:slug` (gallery, metal/carat/size variants, sticky buy box, related, JSON-LD Product schema).
- **Stripe full-price checkout** (emergentintegrations) — slide-in `CartDrawer` (localStorage `tlj_cart_v1`), Apple/Google Pay express buttons, `/api/checkout/session` (amount computed SERVER-SIDE), `/api/checkout/status/:id` polling, `/api/webhook/stripe`, idempotent `shop_orders` on paid. `STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_emergent`.
- **Homepage "Engagement Rings" section** (`ShopEngagementSection.js`) — shop-by-shape circles + featured product cards.
- **Admin panels** — `/admin/products` (CRUD + "From a Project" → buyable), `/admin/collections` (CRUD), `/admin/menu` (mega-menu builder with per-link hover image upload). Added to AdminLayout nav.

**New backend file:** `commerce_routes.py` (mounted in `server.py`). **Seed:** `seed_commerce.py` (11 collections, 10 products).
**Fonts:** added Cormorant Garamond + Outfit (scoped to `.store`). Design per `/app/design_guidelines.json`.

**Backlog / next for commerce (P1/P2):**
- P1: Customer order confirmation email (Resend/SendGrid) on paid; admin Shop Orders UI page (data exists at `/api/admin/shop-orders`).
- P1: Repoint sitemap.xml to include `/collections/*` and `/products/*` for SEO.
- P2: Embedded Payment/Express Element in the drawer (vs hosted redirect) for fewer steps; real Apple/Google Pay wiring.
- P2: Product reviews UGC, inventory/stock, discount codes, abandoned-cart capture.
- P2: Variant-level pricing (carat upcharges) — currently single price per product.

**Original lead-gen backlog still pending:** SMS step notifications (Twilio), wire frontend social-proof to `/api/admin/settings`, `GET /api/projects/api/list` for HQ, Blog drafts tab, full Quotation/Order mgmt, Pinterest automation, scheduled blog publishing.

## Update 2026-06-10 — Projects = Products unification + Variation pricing + Site-wide Sale ✅ SHIPPED & TESTED (iteration_8: 16/16 backend pass, all FE flows pass)

**User intent:** "Every project is a product — don't create two separate ones." Make each project buyable (with metal + carat variations) as soon as it's added to a collection, via a "Buy this piece" box. Add a site-wide sale with announcement bar + countdown timers. Expose it all over the automation API too.

**Delivered:**
- **Unified entity** — the separate `products` Mongo collection was DROPPED and folded into `projects` (`migrate_products_into_projects.py`). All storefront endpoints (`/api/collections`, `/api/collections/{slug}`, `/api/products`, `/api/products/{slug}`) now read `db.projects` where a project `is_buyable` (has ≥1 collection + a price matrix). Admin "Products" menu removed; only **Projects** remains. Old `/products/:slug` → redirects to `/projects/:slug`.
- **Variation pricing (30-cell matrix)** — `price_matrix = {metal_tier: {carat: price}}`. Metal tiers: `silver, 10k, 14k, 18k, platinum` (5). Carats: `1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4` (6). Gold **colour** (White/Rose/Yellow) is a FREE style choice and never changes price. Lowest filled cell = the "From" price. Shared helpers in `backend/variant_options.py` + `frontend/src/utils/variantOptions.js`.
- **Buy box** (`components/store/BuyBox.js`) on buyable project pages — metal tier + gold-colour swatches + carat selectors → exact matrix price; Add to Bag + Buy It Now (Stripe). Non-buyable projects keep the "Start a piece like this" quote CTA. `PublicHeader` is now cart-aware (cart icon + CartDrawer). Checkout payload now uses `metal_tier` + `carat`; price is recomputed **server-side** from the matrix (never trusts client).
- **Site-wide Sale** — `db.settings {key:'global_sale'}`: enabled + percent + ends_at + headline. Admin page `/admin/sale` (`SalePage.js`). Public `GET /api/shop/sale` (auto-expires past `ends_at`). `SaleAnnouncementBar.js` (announcement bar + countdown), Buy box shows struck original + sale price + countdown, checkout discounts server-side, product cards show compare-at + % off.
- **Admin Projects editor** — new "Shop — Collections & Variation Pricing" card: collection toggle chips + a 30-cell price-matrix table + quick-fill/clear.
- **Automation API** — `POST /api/projects/api/create` & `PUT /api/projects/api/{slug}` now accept `collections` + `price_matrix` (documented in `PROJECTS_API.md`).
- **Cleanup** — removed dead `ShopProductDetailPage.js`, `ProductsAdminPage.js`, stale `test_commerce.py`, `seed_commerce.py`. New regression: `backend/tests/test_unified_shop.py`.

**Data:** 3 real projects (`3-40-carat-oval-side-stone` $1500, `5-carat-oval-solitaire` $1800, `4-41-carat-radiant-hidden-halo` $2850) in the **engagement-rings** collection, each seeded with a flat 30-cell matrix at its from-price — admin should set true per-variant prices.

**Backlog / next for commerce:** per-variant true pricing (admin to fill matrix), order confirmation email on paid + admin Shop Orders UI, sitemap to include `/collections/*`, variant-aware product cards, abandoned cart.
